## Introduction

My name is Steven Richards, welcome to my Blog.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Introduction" />

## Topics

I'm a computer science student, so you'll see content about programming here, and maybe some about what I'm currently studying.

I'm working on some webapp projects currently. I'm using FastAPI and Next.js, but also trying to get better with fundamentals like
Typescript and React.

I'm an IT as a Field Support Tech, so you will also see some random IT subjects.

I love podcasts! I may even share some of my favorites here.

## Tech Goodies

I'm currently hosting this blog through Vercel, but that may change. I wanted to use Cloudflare Pages like I am for the root domain,
but there were some errors encountered with the default deployment options and I haven't tinkered with it yet.

I've setup the email hosting for this domain using Zoho free tier. I can't believe how much they offer completely for free!
I'm given 5GB for free and even allowed a "catch-all" email address for the domain.
